### Full-Stack Engineer

I am a motivated Full-Stack Engineer actively involved in daily portfolio and freelance projects. I began my programming journey as a front-end developer, and after creating my first simple website, I realized my aspiration to independently build full-stack web applications. This realization fueled my dedication to learning and working extensively.
Over time, I have cultivated a diverse skill set, mastering various technologies and frameworks, including React/Redux, Express, and Node. I am proud to have achieved my initial goal of becoming proficient in full-stack development.
Now, my next objective is to ascend to the top tier of developers. So I start step-by-step.
